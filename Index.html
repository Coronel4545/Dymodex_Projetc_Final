										<p class="Oq">What is Dymodex?</p><br>
										<p class="sobre2"> Dymodex is Decentralized Exchange that aims to implement and merge functions that are only found in CEX.<br> As a launch platform for tokens and Nfts. We also intend to implement a token purchase system using fiat currency, buy limit and market orders as well as on CEX.<br> All to make a DEX more comfortable and versatile to wear. After all, Dex has a high potential to surpass CEX in the near future. </p>

	<p class="titulo">Why did we choose Manticora as a symbol of DEX ?</p>
	<p class="Manticora2">We chose the mythological manticore because it has a wide range of offensive and defensive systems. Be fully capable of adapting and solving problems.<br> We believe that the Manticora is the mythological animal that best represents, in the literal sense, the Dymodex proposal. Which is to merge existing DEX and CEX resources into a single Dapp!</p>

							<p class="Liquedez">How will Dymodex liquidity work?</p><br>
							<p class="Como">We started with a low liquidity of approximately $530 dollars. Our first and most important trading pair is DMX/BNB. Our liquidity was deposited in BNB due to low trading volume and considerable high impact on price. We decided to sell, initially at 0% of the purchase price to encourage new investors. Dymodex $DMX to increase liquidity and trading volume After we reach $5,000 liquidity, we will start parity diversification such as DMX/USDT, DMX/WBNB, DMX/BUSD. At this moment we will already have buy and sell fees between 10% and 18% on the purchase or sale of $DMX so that we can reward holders with reflections<br>(there is no reward currency set yet..)</p><br><p class="Consulta">You can check the $DMX token fees<a href="https://honeypot.is/?address=0x6117772e304a2ec403fabe28f1c1300064a09d58" class="consul">Clicking here</a></p>
